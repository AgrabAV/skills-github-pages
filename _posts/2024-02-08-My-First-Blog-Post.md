# "Diving into IT"
---
After meeting with Mdava's family and seeing the freedom given to mdava's cousin and her fiance with a occupation in Cyber Security, 
I knew I wanted that for myself. Not really knowing where to start, I then started to study for CompTIA Sec+ exam late Decemebr. 
I then started to reform my resume to better fit the job that I am chasing for. I recerntly applied to over 50+ jobs ranging from Tech support, IT help desks and Call centres.
I've had 3 job offers so far and with one being remote I feel that I'm lucky to have broken into the industry with little to no downtime.
:joy:
