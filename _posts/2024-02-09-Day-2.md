### Exciting times

---

Since this is Day 2 of my daily blog post, I've decided to use this as an oppurtunity to not only learn the in's and outs of markdown but as a journal that displays the progress I've accumulated thus far.
With today's post I will be showing usage of *Italics*, linking an image, and **bold text**. As it's only been less than 24hrs of recieving my verbal job offer over the phone, my excitement is still running high but I'm now met with a slight trepidation for the upcoming role. 
With the start date looming, I find myself anxious yet highly motivated to be stepping into a new field with vast oppurtunities for growth. As I explained to McDava this could very well be the turning point in my life.
As we progress in this plog post together you'll come to learn characters from my life but none are as important or significant as McDava. Aside from this being offered this position has renewed my confidence in myself despite the lack of support from my immediate family. 
Although heart wrenching, you can't blame the folks for believing what worked for them is what would work for me. **But, I am not them.** and rightfully so, this moment in time can be the *pivotal moment* that marks the beginning of a bright future. I am prepared to grasp this oppurtunity and not let go of what awaits for me.
